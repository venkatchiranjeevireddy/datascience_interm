# Preprocessing, EDA, and Modeling Pipeline

This notebook documents the full workflow I followed for **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and clustering/modeling**. The main focus was to clean, normalize, and prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis, while also ensuring results were interpretable and reproducible.

---

## 1. Preprocessing

- Mounted Google Drive in Colab for reading and saving processed datasets.
- Installed and imported commonly used libraries.
- Defined helper functions to streamline repetitive tasks.
- Performed initial data inspection to understand the raw structure and detect issues.
- Loaded datasets in different modes (with and without date parsing) to avoid parsing errors.
- Standardized column names by trimming whitespace and unifying formats.
- Detected and converted date/time columns to proper datetime objects.
- Created normalized `date` columns for alignment across datasets.
- Cleaned and normalized numeric columns to ensure compatibility across different sources.
- Handled special fields like **sentiment scores**:
  - Standardized sentiment values into a normalized 0–1 range.
  - Rescaled values where necessary (e.g., 0–100 → 0–1).
- Processed trading-related data:
  - Converted fields to numeric where possible.
  - Standardized column names consistently.
  - Computed additional features such as **notional value** and ensured `closed_pnl` column existed.
- Merged multiple data sources (trading data and sentiment data) using the normalized date column.
- Generated basic per-trade features for further modeling.
- Saved the cleaned and merged dataset for reuse.
- Exported small diagnostic samples and transposed previews for manual review.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted basic data quality checks and profiling.
- Explored distributions of key variables such as sentiment, trading metrics, and dates.
- Visualized trends and relationships to identify potential drivers of patterns.
- Checked correlations between trading features and sentiment indicators.
- Validated the correctness of preprocessing steps with sample inspections.

## 3. Modeling and Clustering

- Applied clustering techniques to group trades or data points based on their features.
- Used normalized features (e.g., sentiment, pnl, notional value) for more stable clustering.
- Analyzed the clusters to identify distinct behavioral or market patterns.
- Interpreted model results to extract insights about trade dynamics and sentiment influence.

## Outputs

- **Cleaned dataset** with standardized columns and merged features.
- **Diagnostics reports** for validation.
- **EDA insights** highlighting relationships between sentiment and trades.
- **Clustering/modeling results** to uncover patterns in the data.

## Notes

- This workflow was iterative: preprocessing was refined after feedback from EDA.
- The pipeline ensures that raw financial/trading data and external sentiment sources are consistently aligned.
- Processed data is stored in Google Drive for easy reuse in downstream tasks like predictive modeling or advanced analytics.
